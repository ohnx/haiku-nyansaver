NyanSaver
===========

Screensaver for Haiku, loosely based on [jessicah's Neon Sparkles](https://github.com/jessicah/neonsparkles), which is in turn based on [PulkoMandy's Neon Lines](https://github.com/pulkomandy/neonlights), which in turn is loosely based on [Jared Tarbell's work](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/citytraveler/).

Why?
----
