Neon Sparkles
===========

Screensaver for Haiku, based on [PulkoMandy's Neon Lines](https://github.com/pulkomandy/neonlights), which in turn is loosely based on [Jared Tarbell's work](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/machines/citytraveler/).

Why?
----

Because I didn't like the noise in Neon Lights :p
